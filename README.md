# Image-Captioning-Project
Using deep learning the model will generate captions for the given image.
Image captioning can be regarded as an end-to-end Sequence to Sequence problem, as it converts images, which is regarded as a sequence of pixels to a sequence of words. For this purpose, we need to process both the language or statements and the images. For the Language part, we use recurrent Neural Networks and for the Image part, we use Convolutional Neural Networks to obtain the feature vectors respectively
